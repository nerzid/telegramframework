# Nerzid Telegram Bot Framework

### This framework uses [TelegramAPI](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots)

To download type `git clone https://github.com/nerzid/telegramframework.git` in your favourite terminal

## What does this Nerzid Bot has ?
- Everything that simple Telegram API bot can do, plus
- StopWatch
- Timer
- And -this is the best part-, **commands !**

## How can I add a new Command ?
- Firstly, **create** a Java class and then **extend** *Cmd* class
- Then **implement** all abstract methods as you need. I've put a class named **CmdSubscribe** to give you a hint about creating a custom command class.
